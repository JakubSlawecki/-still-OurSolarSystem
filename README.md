# -still-OurSolarSystem


## ARkit

It's an idea for app for students at school, so that in an expanded reality they can add an animated solar system. Thanks to this, students can create a whole solar system in the courtyard, for example in front of the school, and learn how planets move around the Sun, including their moons. I use this application to learn to create app's using Arkit, so please do not pay attention to the fact that most of the code is in ViewController ;)
